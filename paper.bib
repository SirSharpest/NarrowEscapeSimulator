  abstract = {We model the motion of a receptor on the membrane surface of a synapse as free Brownian motion in a planar domain with intermittent trappings in and escapes out of corrals with narrow openings. We compute the mean confinement time of the Brownian particle in the asymptotic limit of a narrow opening and calculate the probability to exit through a given small opening, when the boundary contains more than one. Using this approach, it is possible to describe the Brownian motion of a random particle in an environment containing domains with small openings by a coarse grained diffusion process. We use the results to estimate the confinement time as a function of the parameters and also the time it takes for a diffusing receptor to be anchored at its final destination on the postsynaptic membrane, after it is inserted in the membrane. This approach provides a framework for the theoretical study of receptor trafficking on membranes. This process underlies synaptic plasticity, which relates to learning and memory. In particular, it is believed that the memory state in the brain is stored primarily in the pattern of synaptic weight values, which are controlled by neuronal activity. At a molecular level, the synaptic weight is determined by the number and properties of protein channels (receptors) on the synapse. The synaptic receptors are trafficked in and out of synapses by a diffusion process. Following their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, receptors are trafficked to their postsynaptic sites on dendrites and axons. In this model the receptors are first inserted into the extrasynaptic plasma membrane and then random walk in and out of corrals through narrow openings on their way to their final destination.},

  abstract = {The study of the diffusive motion of ions or molecules in confined biological microdomains requires the derivation of the explicit dependence of quantities, such as the decay rate of the population or the forward chemical reaction rate constant on the geometry of the domain. Here, we obtain this explicit dependence for a model of a Brownian particle (ion, molecule, or protein) confined to a bounded domain (a compartment or a cell) by a reflecting boundary, except for a small window through which it can escape. We call the calculation of the mean escape time the narrow escape problem. This time diverges as the window shrinks, thus rendering the calculation a singular perturbation problem. Here, we present asymptotic formulas for the mean escape time in several cases, including regular domains in two and three dimensions and in some singular domains in two dimensions. The mean escape time comes up in many applications, because it represents the mean time it takes for a molecule to hit a target binding site. We present several applications in cellular biology: calcium decay in dendritic spines, a Markov model of multicomponent chemical reactions in microdomains, dynamics of receptor diffusion on the surface of neurons, and vesicle trafficking inside a cell.},

  abstract = {Mathematical modelling of the movement of animals, micro-organisms and cells is of great relevance in the fields of biology, ecology and medicine. Movement models can take many different forms, but the most widely used are based on the extensions of simple random walk processes. In this review paper, our aim is twofold: to introduce the mathematics behind random walks in a straightforward manner and to explain how such models can be used to aid our understanding of biological processes. We introduce the mathematical theory behind the simple random walk and explain how this relates to Brownian motion and diffusive processes in general. We demonstrate how these simple models can be extended to include drift and waiting times or be used to calculate first passage times. We discuss biased random walks and show how hyperbolic models can be used to generate correlated random walks. We cover two main applications of the random walk model. Firstly, we review models and results relating to the movement, dispersal and population redistribution of animals and micro-organisms. This includes direct calculation of mean squared displacement, mean dispersal distance, tortuosity measures, as well as possible limitations of these model approaches. Secondly, oriented movement and chemotaxis models are reviewed. General hyperbolic models based on the linear transport equation are introduced and we show how a reinforced random walk can be used to model movement where the individual changes its environment. We discuss the applications of these models in the context of cell migration leading to blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). Finally, we discuss how the various random walk models and approaches are related and the connections that underpin many of the key processes involved.},

  abstract = {We present an efficient method to solve the narrow capture and narrow escape problems for the sphere. The narrow capture problem models the equilibrium behavior of a Brownian particle in the exterior of a sphere whose surface is reflective, except for a collection of small absorbing patches. The narrow escape problem is the dual problem: it models the behavior of a Brownian particle confined to the interior of a sphere whose surface is reflective, except for a collection of small patches through which it can escape. Mathematically, these give rise to mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary value problems of the Poisson equation. They are numerically challenging for two main reasons: (1) the solutions are non-smooth at Dirichlet-Neumann interfaces, and (2) they involve adaptive mesh refinement and the solution of large, ill-conditioned linear systems when the number of small patches is large. By using the Neumann Green's functions for the sphere, we recast each boundary value problem as a system of first-kind integral equations on the collection of patches. A block-diagonal preconditioner together with a multiple scattering formalism leads to a well-conditioned system of second-kind integral equations and a very efficient approach to discretization. This system is solved iteratively using GMRES. We develop a hierarchical, fast multipole method-like algorithm to accelerate each matrix-vector product. Our method is insensitive to the patch size, and the total cost scales with the number N of patches as O(Nlog‚Å°N), after a precomputation whose cost depends only on the patch size and not on the number or arrangement of patches. We demonstrate the method with several numerical examples, and are able to achieve highly accurate solutions with 100000 patches in one hour on a 60-core workstation. For that case, adaptive discretization of each patch would lead to a dense linear system with about 360 million degrees of freedom. Our preconditioned system uses only 13.6 million ``compressed'' degrees of freedom and a few dozen GMRES iterations.},
