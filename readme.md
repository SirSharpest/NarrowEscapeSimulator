# Narrow Escape Simulator

This is a python 3 library which provides ready-made simulations for determining the average escape time for a Brownian particle out of a container.

Examples are provided in the `notebooks` folder.

# Installation

On python 3 simply clone the repository and run:

``` bash
pip install .
```

Running the examples notebook will require additional requirements which can be installed with:

``` bash
pip install jupyter tqdm
```

# Contributions
